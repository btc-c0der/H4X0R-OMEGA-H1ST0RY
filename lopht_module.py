## ADVISORY: Windows NT Passwords Cryptographically Weak

**Release Date**: March 1997
**Severity**: Critical
**Systems Affected**: All Windows NT systems

## DESCRIPTION
The authentication mechanism used in Windows NT is cryptographically weak and allows attackers to brute force passwords regardless of password complexity.

## DETAILS
Microsoft's implementation of the LM hash algorithm:
1. Converts all lowercase to uppercase
2. Pads passwords to 14 characters
3. Splits the password into two 7 character chunks
4. Creates a hash from each chunk separately

This implementation significantly reduces the complexity of cracking passwords as each 7-character chunk can be attacked independently.

## PROOF OF CONCEPT
The L0phtCrack tool demonstrates this vulnerability by recovering Windows NT password hashes at high speed using standard hardware.

## RECOMMENDATION
- Use NTLM instead of LM hash where possible
- Implement strong password policies
- Consider additional authentication factors
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
