## An Analysis of the Brazilian Hacker Group Inferno.BR: Activities and Law Enforcement Interaction (c. 2000-2001)

### 1. Executive Summary

Inferno.BR emerged as a notable Brazilian hacker group during the nascent stages of the country's cyber landscape, primarily active around the years 2000 and early 2001. The group gained significant notoriety, contributing to the international perception of Brazilian hackers, sometimes referred to as "Backers". Their known activities included website defacement, a common practice among Brazilian hacker groups of that era. However, Inferno.BR is most frequently cited for alleged high-profile intrusions against sensitive international targets, specifically NASA and NATO systems, reportedly occurring in late 1999 and 2000. Despite these claims circulating in multiple sources, the provided documentation lacks specific technical details regarding the methods, scope, or verified impact of these alleged breaches. The group is widely considered defunct, having ceased operations sometime after its period of peak activity. Critically, based on the available information, there is no documented evidence of specific law enforcement actions, such as investigations leading to arrests or charges by Brazilian or international authorities, directly targeting Inferno.BR or its members for their activities during this timeframe.

### 2. Introduction: The Early Brazilian Cybercrime Landscape (Late 1990s - Early 2000s)

The emergence of Inferno.BR coincided with the rapid expansion of internet connectivity in Brazil. Commercial internet services became available between 1995 and 1996, setting the stage for a burgeoning online culture. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, platforms like Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and ICQ messenger, alongside bulletin board systems (BBS) and web forums, became the primary communication hubs. IRC, in particular, served as the forum of choice for hackers, hosting discussions, advertisements for illicit services, and coordination of activities. Popular Brazilian IRC networks like Brasirc and Brasnet were fertile ground for early cyber activities, including denial-of-service attacks, username takeovers, and other coordinated efforts.

During this period, website defacement was a dominant form of hacking activity in Brazil. This often involved altering webpages to display messages, advertise compromises, or express political views. Many participants were reportedly teenagers, typically aged between 15 and 22, who viewed defacement as a learning experience, a way to test skills in exploiting software vulnerabilities and poorly configured systems. The motivations varied, ranging from simple curiosity and the technical challenge, to warning system administrators, gaining notoriety within the community, or engaging in early forms of hacktivism. The desire for recognition was evident in the frequent reporting of defacements to public archives like Zone-H and the German site Alldas.de, where Brazil consistently ranked among the top contributors. By June 2001, Brazil reportedly ranked third globally with 1,453 defaced websites cataloged on Alldas.de, highlighting the scale of this activity.

Inferno.BR operated alongside several other prominent Brazilian groups active in the early 2000s IRC era. These included groups primarily focused on website defacement, such as Prime Suspectz, Silver Lords, Insanity Zine, HFury, DataCha0s, and Crime Boys. Other groups, like Unsekurity Scene (or "unsek") and its associated spin-offs Clube dos Mercenários (CDM) and Front The Scene (FTS), were more involved in general hacking and security research, exploring reconnaissance, penetration testing, and vulnerability exploitation. The Brazilian hacker community during this time was characterized by its sociability, with active interaction, information exchange, and meetings occurring between different groups, often facilitated by IRC channels.

The nature of these early activities, dominated by defacement and driven by younger participants seeking recognition or making statements, contrasts significantly with the trajectory of Brazilian cybercrime in later years. Subsequent reports describe Brazil becoming an "epicenter of a global cybercrime wave" focused on financially motivated activities like online banking fraud, financial malware (such as banking Trojans), phishing campaigns, carding (credit card fraud), and ransomware attacks. This evolution suggests that groups like Inferno.BR belonged to an earlier phase of Brazilian cyber activity where motivations centered more on technical exploration, notoriety, and hacktivism, rather than the organized, profit-driven cybercrime that would later define the landscape.

The sheer volume and high visibility of actions attributed to Brazilian groups in this early period, including the widely reported alleged intrusions by Inferno.BR, led to significant international recognition. This notoriety solidified into a distinct identity within the global hacking scene, captured by the term "Backer" (Brazilian Hacker). This label, mentioned in guides from the period, reflects the impact these early groups had, establishing Brazil as a notable origin point for cyber activity, albeit often viewed through the lens of disruption and perceived threat.

### 3. Inferno.BR: Emergence and Operations

Inferno.BR is confirmed through multiple sources as a Brazilian hacker group active during the early 2000s. The group's primary period of activity appears concentrated around the year 2000 and early 2001. A SANS Institute paper dated July 16, 2001, refers to the group's alleged NASA and NATO breaches as having occurred "last year" (implying 2000). News reports from early 2000 also mention Inferno.BR's activities, including a claimed NASA hack in December 1999 and a NATO hack in late 2000. Defacement logs from Attrition.org also record activity attributed to Inferno.BR in January 2000. Later sources refer to the group as "extinct" ("já extinto"), indicating that their operations ceased sometime after this peak period.

The group's activities primarily fall into two categories based on the available information:

1. **Website Defacement**: Given the context of the early Brazilian hacking scene and Inferno.BR's inclusion alongside known defacement crews, defacement was likely a core activity. Specific examples logged on the Attrition.org defacement mirror include attacks on microsoft.com.tw and cmmr.com.cn on January 4, 2000. An attack against Brazil's Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) is also attributed to the group, though the date is unspecified.

2. **System Intrusions (Alleged)**: Inferno.BR gained significant notoriety for alleged intrusions into high-profile international systems. The most frequently cited targets are NASA and NATO. Some sources also vaguely mention intrusions into Microsoft, FBI, and Interpol systems in the same context as Inferno.BR's activities, though without specific details or confirmation.

Despite the notoriety associated with these alleged intrusions, the provided sources offer no specific technical details about the methods employed by Inferno.BR. The vulnerabilities exploited, tools used, or specific techniques remain undocumented in this corpus. The taunting message reportedly left after the NASA intrusion – comparing Brazilian government security unfavorably to NASA's – might hint at exploiting perceived security weaknesses or a desire to demonstrate technical prowess, but provides no concrete methodological information.

A notable discrepancy exists between the widespread claims of high-profile intrusions (NASA, NATO) and the available, albeit limited, defacement archive data. The Attrition.org logs from January 2000 list less prominent targets for Inferno.BR, whereas multiple contemporary and later reports emphasize the NASA and NATO incidents. This inconsistency suggests several possibilities: the NASA/NATO incidents may have involved deeper system compromises without public defacement, making them invisible to defacement archives; the attribution to Inferno.BR might have originated from unverified claims made by the group or others; or the specific archives referenced or available might be incomplete. This highlights the inherent challenges in verifying historical hacking claims based solely on publicly accessible records from the period.
